      The past few years our planet has been polluted continuously. Mainly
      caused by humans. Pollution has significant impacts on human health, the
      environment, and even on how some of the Earth's systems, such as the
      climate, are functioning. Pollution touches all parts of the planet. It is
      affecting our health through the food we eat, the water we drink and the
      air we breathe. But how can we protect our planet before its too late?
    </p>

    <p>We still can help save the planet. But we all need to try.</p>

    <p>
      By using public transport and bicycles is a sure short way of contributing
      to less air pollution as it provides with less gas and energy. In
      addition, we can recycle and reuse because it is helpful for air pollution
      as it helps in reducing pollution emissions. The recycled products also
      take less power to make other products. Moreover, using plastic products
      could be very harmful to the environment as they take a very long time to
      decompose. Using paper bags instead of plasic is a better alternative as
      they are recyclable and they don't harm the seas. Furthermore, you should
      report people who pour oil in storm drains, toss bags of trash in the
      seas. Because they harm it very badly by killing fishes that live in the
      sea. For example, a turtle can see a plastic bag and think that is is
      food. At last, we can plant new trees to forests that are destroyed by
      either fires or normal causes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In conlusion, pollution happens everywhere in the planet. Either it is in
      the environment or if it is in the seas. We all contribute to polluting
      our world even if we don't want to. Some people do it consiously thinking
      they have no choice, but that is not true. There is always a solution.
      There is always another way. Most of us want to help save the environment
      but actions are the ones that speak louder than words.
